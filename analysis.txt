Data Analysis conducted on the Iris Dataset


The shape of the dataset:
(150, 5)

The dataset contains 150 rows of data and 5 columns. The 5 columns are the species of isis flower (here noted as 'class'), and sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The first and last five rows of the dataset are printed below, as well as the column names within the dataset.

The column names of the dataset:
Index(['sepal length', 'sepal width', 'petal length', 'petal width', 'class'], dtype='object')

These print checks were conducted to ensure that the data was correctly imported and in the correct format.
The number of rows and columns in the dataset:
None

The number of missing values in the dataset:
sepal length    0
sepal width     0
petal length    0
petal width     0
class           0
dtype: int64

The number of duplicate rows in the dataset:
3

The data types of each column in the dataset:
sepal length    float64
sepal width     float64
petal length    float64
petal width     float64
class            object
dtype: object

Missing values were checked for in the dataset, there were none.
If there were missing values, the dataset would need to be cleaned and sorted further before any analysis could be conducted.
There were no missing values in this dataset, so further cleaning was unnecessary.

From the information table, it can be seen that where one column has categorical (object) data (class column - also referred to as species for this dataset) 
and the four other columns (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) are of the float type (float64) (continuous variables) with non-Null entries. That is, there are no 0 / null~ entries in the dataset.

Duplicates were removed from the data using the drop_duplicates function.
The code used for this was: 	data = iris_df.drop_duplicates(subset=class.)
Value counts for each of the species:
class
Iris-setosa        50
Iris-versicolor    50
Iris-virginica     50
Name: count, dtype: int64

It can be seen that there are 50 samples for each of the three classes (species) of iris, setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

The summary statistics for the whole dataset shows that there are 150 samples in the dataset for each of the variables, the value displayed is the non-missing values, and thus it can be verified that the dataset does not have any missing values. 
	Please Note: Summary statistics observations taken from my own work for the Principles of Data Analytics Module, with wording changed to match what was required for this project. Link: https://github.com/KaiiMenai/poda-tasks/blob/main/tasks.ipynb
The Mean, Standard Deviation (std), Minimum (min) and Maximum (max), and the Lower, Median, and Higher Inter-quartile Ranges (25%, 50%, and 75%, respectively) values are displayed for all four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).
The Mean was calculated by dividing the sum of all the values (per feature) by the number of values (150 in this case). The mean for sepal length was 5.84 cm, sepal width was 3.05 cm, petal length was 3.76 cm, and for petal width was 1.20 cm. 

The Standard Deviation (std) is a measure of the spread of the data, that is, on average, how much the values deviate from the mean. Sepal length had a mean of 5.84 cm with a std of 0.83, therefore the majority of values deviate by 0.83 cm (+/-) from the mean. 
The mean for sepal width was 3.05 cm with a std of 0.43 cm, the sepal widths deviated by +/- 0.43 cm from the mean. The feature, sepal width, had less variability (std = 0.43) compared to that of sepal length (std = 0.83). 
For petal length, the mean was 3.76 cm with a std of 1.76 cm, thus most values for petal length deviated by 1.76 cm (+/-). Petal width had a mean of 1.20 cm with a std of 0.76 cm, the width of petals deviated by +/- 0.76 cm. 
The measurement with the largest deviation from the mean is the petal length (std = 1.76), this suggests that petal lengths vary more widely across samples compared to the other features.

In the Summary Statistics for each species, the count shows that there are 50 samples in the dataset for each, the values displayed is the non-missing value, suggesting that there are no missing values present in the dataset.

	Iris Setosa.

The mean for sepal length was AAA cm, sepal width was BBB cm, petal length was CCC cm, and for petal width the mean was DDD cm. The mean was calculated by dividing the sum of all the values (per feature) by the number of values (50 in this case, as it is done by species('class')).

The standard deviation (std) is a measure of the spread of the data, that is, on average, how much the values deviate from the mean. For sepal length the mean was AAA cm and the std was AAA, therefore most values deviated by AAA cm (+/-) from the mean.
The mean for sepal width was BBB cm and the std was BBB, so most values deviated by +/- BBB cm from the mean.
Petal length had a mean of

	Boxplots by Feature.

Boxplots were plotted for each of the four measured features (sepal length/width and petal length/width), the data in each of these four plots is separated by species. Boxplots make visualising range, potential outliers, the inter-quartile range, and the median of the data more easily.

There were nine outliers in total within the dataset between the four sepal/petal features. The Setosa species had three outliers in the data for petal length, and two outliers in the data for petal width. The Virginica species had one outlier for sepal length and two outliers for sepal width. The Versicolor species had the fewest number of outliers with only one outlier throughout the whole dataset, this outlier was for petal length.
On average, Setosa was found to have the shortest sepal length and widest sepal width. Setosa was also found to have the shortest petal length measurements and narrowest petal width. For Versicolor and Virginica, there were some differences visible in the measurements for the four features (sepal length/width, petal length/width), however, there were instances where the feature measurements converged, particularly for sepal length and sepal width. Petal length and petal width displayed differences between species, indicating that these feature measurements may be valuable for classification of Iris species.

	Histograms by Feature.

The histogram plots are all colour coded by species; blue for Setosa, orange for Versicolor, and green for Virginica.

From the histogram plot for sepal length by species, the Setosa species showed a normal distribution, with the majority of sepals being approximately 5.0 cm in length. The Versicolor species has a broad range of sepal lengths, with the most sepals being approximately 5.5 cm in length. The species with the largest range in length of sepals and longest average sepal length is the Virginica species.

For sepal width, it can be seen that overall, the data shows a normal distribution. Contrary to what was observed for sepal length, the narrowest sepal width is the Versicolor species, with the Virginica species being in the middle of the range. The Setosa species had the greatest width and the broadest range in values for sepal width.

Similar to what was observed for sepal length, for petal length Setosa was the species with the shortest average length and the smallest range in measurements. An average petal length of approximately 4.5 cm was observed for the Versicolor species and demonstrated a normal distribution. The Virginica species had, on average, the longest petal lengths, similar to what was observed for sepal lengths.

Setosa species had the narrowest petal width on average. The species with the mid-width measurement was the Versicolor species, with values between 1.0 cm and 2.0 cm. The widest petal widths were observed in the Virginica species.

 It was observed that the sepal width and petal width for the Setosa species were contrary to one another. For the petal measurements of length and width, the Setosa species was the shortest and narrowest and the values for this species also separated away from the other two species.

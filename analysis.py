# analysis.py
# This program will import and analyse the data from the iris dataset. 
# Figures will be output and saved as appropriate.

# Commencement date: 03/04/2025

# Importing libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

# Into terminal: pip install ucimlrepo


# Basic data checks - check for missing values, duplicates, and data types


# Summarise each variable in the dataset and check for outliers - export to a single text file.


# Histograms - plot and save histograms for each variable in the dataset as a png file.
# Use seaborn for better aesthetics


# Scatter plots - plot and save scatter plots for each pair of variables in the dataset as a png file.
# Use seaborn for better aesthetics
# Use a loop to create scatter plots for each pair of variables

# Other analysis types that may be apprropriate - for each ensure that the figure is saved as a png file.
# - Box plots
# - Pair plots
# - Correlation matrix
# - Heatmaps
# - PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
# - Clustering analysis (e.g., K-means clustering)


# This is a placeholder for the other analysis types that may be appropriate. - DELETE THIS LINE


# This dataset has previously been used for machine learning and classification tasks, so it may be useful to explore some of those techniques as well.
# - Linear Regression
# - Logistic Regression
# Discuss the pros and cons of each technique and how they may be applied to this dataset.

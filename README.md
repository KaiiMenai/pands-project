## Problem statement - DELETE
This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set [3]. You must research the data set
and write documentation and code (in Python [1]) to investigate it. An online search for
information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated it
previously. You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that
are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed.
You might do that for this project as follows:
    1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
    2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
    3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
        1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
        2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
        3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
        4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate.
